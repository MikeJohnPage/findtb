## Overview

The findtb package downloads TB data from the WHO, cleans the data, and
then exports it into a standard rectangular format for use in the gap package.

The package exports seven datasets:

- `tb_all` (all of the below combined)
- `tb_budget`
- `tb_community`
- `tb_estimates`
- `tb_expenditure`
- `tb_labs`
- `tb_notifications`

It also ships with a data dictionary to lookup definitions and a list of high TB
burden countries:

- `tb_dictionary`
- `tb_high_burden`

## Installation

``` r
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mikejohnpage/findtb")
```
## Usage
```{r}
library(findtb)

# Load a dataset, for example, tb estimates:
tb_estimates

# Lookup variable defintions in the dictionary:
tb_dictionary |>
  dplyr::filter(dataset == "tb_estimates")

# Return the estimates for 2021 of only the high TB burden countries:
tb_estimates |> 
  dplyr::filter(year == 2021) |> 
  dplyr::semi_join(tb_high_burden)
```

## Development

To add data sets to the package:

1. Add a file to `data-raw/`, exporting a dataset to `data/`.
2. Update `R/tb_all.R` and `R/tb_dictionary.R`.
3. Update and rebuild the documentation in `R/data.R`, if required.
4. Rebuild the package.
